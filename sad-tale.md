House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm, Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned Stark stayed in Winterfell and lived a long and prosperous life surrounded by his family.

this is a much happier story :)
